# Ctrl-Q NR

Node-RED nodes for interacting with cloud and client-managed Qlik Sense

Ctrl-Q NR is a collection of Node-RED nodes that allow you to interact with Qlik Sense, both the cloud and on-premises (=client-managed) versions.  
The nodes are designed to be easy to use and can be used to build powerful data-driven applications and integrations in Node-RED.

## Installation

To use these nodes, you will need to have Node-RED installed. Once you have Node-RED installed, you can install these nodes using the Node-RED palette manager.

1. Open Node-RED
2. Click on the menu icon in the top-right corner
3. Click on "Manage palette"
4. Click on the "Install" tab
5. Search for "ctrl-q-nr"
6. Click "Install"

## Usage

Once you have installed the nodes, you can use them in your Node-RED flows. The nodes are organized into different categories based on their functionality. To use a node, simply drag it from the palette onto your flow and configure it using the node's properties.

For more information on how to use these nodes, please refer to the [documentation](https://ptarmiganlabs.com/ctrl-q-nr/) and articles at [ptarmiganlabs.com](https://ptarmiganlabs.com).
